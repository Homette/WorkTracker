WorkTracker
===========

Track units of work throughout the day. Provides a simple interface to measure the duration of one or more tasks throughout a day of work. A short summary lists the tasks that have been worked on and the amount of time spent on each task in hours and minutes.

This is very much still work in progress and UI, especially animation and state, need more testing and bugfixing through chaos-tests. The basic functionality is in the application and working. 

Requires basically a complete Qt 5.2 installation's library files. More polish to come!
